## 3D printing
These models were designed for MJF printing, and do not take into account the limitations of FDM printing. So this is not possible to print on your average FDM home printer.
I've ordered my prints from JLCPCB's 3D printing service. SLS printing could also work, but I have not tried; you may run into slight
issues with tolerances.
