## 3D printing
I reccomend to go with the MX version. The original choc version is not very comfortable to use as a standalone device.

These models were designed for MJF printing, and do not take into account the limitations of FDM printing. It is possible to print these in FDM, but it does require being a bit smart about the support settings for the top housing. I do not have an FDM printer myself, so I do not have recommendations for support settings, though I know there's at least one person who did succesfully print one on their FDM printer.

I've ordered my prints in MJF from JLCPCB's 3D printing service. SLS printing could also work, but I have not tried; you may run into slight issues with tolerances.
