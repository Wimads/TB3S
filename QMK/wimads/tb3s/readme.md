**CREDITS:**
This firmware was based on the QMK firmware from Ploopy Madromys and Bastardkb Charybdis; all credits for firmware development go to them, I merely cobbled together from both what I needed.
* Ploopy Madromys was used as a template for the hardware configuration (since its also based on rp2040 and pmw3360)
* Bastardkb Charybdis firmware was used to implement the same trackball funcitonalities (dragscroll, sniping, etc); so you can use all the same keycodes and configurations for trackball as in bkb Charybdis

**Disclaimer:**
* If you're not familiar with QMK, please first read up on that. Google is your friend.
* This firmware will NOT be maintained, since I am no developer, and not a company - this was merely a hobby project - I have included these files only as a starting point for your own work.
* As such, there will be NO support from my end. If you need help with QMK, there's plenty of channels (reddit, discord, whatever you fancy).
* You'll have to copy these files into your own QMK fork to get started (there is and will not be a PR to merge this into QMK mainline). Or ofc start from scratch yourself.
* This firmware worked as is on QMK mainline on 10 januari 2024, but there is no guarantee it will remain functional after future QMK updates.
